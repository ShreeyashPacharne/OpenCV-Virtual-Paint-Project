# Vitual Paint OpenCV

My project is about virtual graphical programming.
This program uses the OpenCV library to detect specific color objects in a live stream 
from webcam or in a video file stored in the local machine. This program detects 
colors in real time and tracks it. It uses pre-trained XML classifiers for the same. 
The classifiers used in this program have facial features trained in them. 
Different classifiers can be used to detect different objects.
